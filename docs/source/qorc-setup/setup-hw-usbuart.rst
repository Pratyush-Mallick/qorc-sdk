USB-UART cable (3.3 V)
======================

Any of the 3.3v USB UART cables can be used for connecting the UART of the Development Board to the PC.

Most common cables use one of the FTDI FT232x/Prolific PL2303x/Silabs CP210x chips.

Ensure to get a good quality UART cable to avoid potential problems such as baud rate mismatch (some clone chips do not play well at all baud rates), and cable quality issues.
