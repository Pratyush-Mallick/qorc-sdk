QORC-SDK
========

QuickLogic Open Reconfigurable Computing (QORC) SDK provides components needed to get started on the QuickLogic's EOSS3 device and open source development boards such as Quickfeather.

The QORC SDK is currently based on FreeRTOS.

Easiest way to get started with the QORC-SDK is to build and run example application projects on the QuickFeather Board.

Refer to :doc:`/qorc-setup/qorc-setup` for setting up the development environment and to be able to build and flash a simple application on the QuickFeather Board.


.. todo: Add a brief explanation of the various components of the SDK here.
